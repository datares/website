# Reseach Team FAQ

## What projects will I be working on if Iâ€™m on the Research Team?
Please visit our website to learn more about the Research Team and the projects that we have worked on in the past: https://datares.github.io/#/research

** During Winter 2021, we will be tackling a problem using [GANs](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-generative-adversarial-networks-gans/) **

## What does the recruitment process look like?
After completing the written application, we will send you a short assessment to evaluate your skills with Python and understanding of machine learning problems, as these are important skills which will be utilized on the Research Team.

## What skill-set does the average Research Team member have?
We are looking for individuals who have sufficient experience in building machine learning models in Python as well as some background in working with Deep Learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. This quarter, we will be tackling a project based on GANs, so any prior experience in working with GANs or the aptitude to learn is much appreciated.

## What does the time commitment look like per week?
We expect Research team members to commit close to 4-5 hours a week which involves learning the required concepts, actively participating in the meetings and making contributions to our GitHub as per the project guidelines.

## How competitive is the application process for Research?
We do not have a hard number cap, but our capacity is much more limited as compared to the Data Blog team. In Fall 2020 we had about 12 members on the Research Team.
