# Consulting Team FAQ

## What projects will I be working on if I’m on the Consulting Team?
The projects that the consulting team takes on are split between two domains- business analytics and sports analytics. In both teams we use statistics, data mining, and visualizations to deliver data-driven insights to our clients. 

Our **business analytics** consulting teams work quarter-long projects for companies with the option of renewing the partnership at the end of every quarter. If you are interested in answering questions like “how do we use customer feedback data to improve our product selection” or “how do we increase the number of paid subscribers on our platform” then DataRes consulting is for you!

Our **sports analytics** consulting team (not currently recruiting) typically recruits internally from our data blog and research teams. The team derives insights for UCLA athletics teams that are used to prevent injuries, build team strength and conditioning programs, and influence gametime strategies. To learn more about the athletics teams reach out to our Athletics team head William Huang. 

## What does the recruitment process look like?
This Fall will be the first time that DataRes consulting will be recruiting externally. Consulting team written applications will open up on September 20th and be reviewed on a rolling basis, if we decide to move forward with your application we will reach out to schedule interviews during Week 1 and Week 2.  On the application we will give you a short description of each team and you will have the opportunity to select whichever project you prefer, and if you do not have a preference we will place you on the team that we think would be the best fit.
