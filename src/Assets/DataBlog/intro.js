## What is Data Blog?
​
The Data Blog team focuses on deriving insights from data to develop fun and informative articles on Medium. Each quarter, members will collaborate in teams to find data of a topic of interest, conduct data analysis in R or Python, build meaningful visualizations, and communicate their findings through a written article. As a Data Blog member, you will gain experience in data storytelling through the article development process and engaging in weekly meetings to present your findings. Check out some of our previous work below or at https://medium.com/@ucladatares!
​
## How are teams formed?
​
Members are grouped into teams by their technical skills, writing interests, and time commitment. Each team will consist of about 1 project lead and 2-4 other Data Blog members with a range of experiences and interests. Teams are shuffled every quarter for members to get a chance to meet and work with different people in Data Blog.
​
## What is a Project Lead?
​
Each quarter, several members of the Data Blog team are selected to be a Project Lead. Project Leads ensure that teams are motivated and on-task so that articles are completed in a timely manner. Project Leads also help to promote team bonding to build a stronger community within Data Blog and DataRes.
