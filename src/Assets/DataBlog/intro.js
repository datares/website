## What is Data Blog?
​
The Data Blog team focuses on deriving insights from data to develop fun and informative articles on Medium. Each quarter, members will collaborate in teams to find data of a topic of interest, conduct data analysis in R or Python, build meaningful visualizations, and communicate their findings through a written article. As a Data Blog member, you will gain experience in data storytelling through the article development process and engaging in weekly meetings to present your findings.
